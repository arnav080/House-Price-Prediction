# House Price Prediction

This project is a House Price Prediction application developed using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. It serves as a practical demonstration of the knowledge gained while learning Pandas and NumPy.

### Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess raw data to handle missing values, categorical variables, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA to gain insights into the data, visualize distributions, correlations, and relationships among variables.
- **Model Training:** Utilize various regression algorithms from Scikit-learn to train predictive models on the processed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Prediction:** Deploy the trained model to predict house prices for new data inputs.
